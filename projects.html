        Notable past projects from my secondary school and early university years. Check out my 
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelvzhan/">LinkedIn</a> profile for more recent, leadership and volunteering
        oriented work.

        The below offers a glimpse into my early programming journey. I still vividly remember finding my first
        programming book at aged ten (<em>Visual Basic for Dummies</em>), building my
        <a href="https://github.com/kz/four-beat-tempo">first Android app</a> in 2014, going to my first hackathon (MLH
        Launch Hack) the same October, followed by building my first mock-startup in a summer camp in Boston at
        <a href="https://www.leangap.org/">Leangap</a> in 2015.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can find 50+ other projects <a href="https://github.com/kz?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=">on GitHub</a>,
        but do bear in mind that the majority of these were built before university, at a time where my focus was solely
        on coding, contrasting against my current focus of developing well-rounded software engineering and leadership
        skills.
