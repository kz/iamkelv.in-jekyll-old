    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My main interest is software engineering. I have been programming from a young age, with most of my work being with web development, predominantly with the PHP framework, <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a>. My interest in system software has developed over the past few years, building various projects with languages best suited to their use cases (including Python, Java and <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>).</p>
    <p>I also hold a casual interest in infosec. I love listening to talks, keeping up to date with recent events, and improving my own cybersecurity skills. I have also participated in bug bounties (including Facebook and eBay's) and CTFs.</p>
    <p>A few of my specific current interests and projects:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Learning to build for scale (distributed systems), including taking a deep dive into architecture (Cassandra, Docker and so many other things!)</li>
        <li><a href="https://artificial.io/products">Insurtech</a>, working at Artificial Labs to digitise a traditionally paper-based industry</li>
        <li>Finding ways to improve traditionally insecure DVRs by building <a href="https://github.com/kz/swanntools">my own software replacement</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also quite regularly attend hackathons, so you may see me around at them. Outside of computing, I like to play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWNamssrZAY">fives</a> (squash, but with your hands!) and read sci-fi novels. </p>
