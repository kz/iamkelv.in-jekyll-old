My main interest is software engineering. I have been programming from a young age, with most of my early work involving building web applications with the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) framework. My interest in system software has developed over the past few years, especially in the field of distributed and scalable systems. In my more recent projects, I've explored newer languages, including [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/), [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and [Go](https://golang.org/) (which I'm particularly fond of).

From recent projects and work, some interesting things I've done include:
- investigating vulnerabilities in a Swann security camera DVR and [building my own software replacement](https://github.com/kz/swanntools);
- working at Bloomberg on an open source chaos engineering tool for Kubernetes called [PowerfulSeal](https://github.com/bloomberg/powerfulseal);
- building software to digitise the traditionally paper-based insurance industry at [Artificial Labs](https://artificial.io/).

I also hold a casual interest in infosec. I love listening to talks, keeping up to date with recent events, and improving my own cybersecurity skills. I have also participated in bug bounties (including Facebook and eBay's) and CTFs.

I also quite regularly attend hackathons, so you may see me around at them. Outside of computing, I play [fives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWNamssrZAY) (squash, but with your hands!) and enjoy reading sci-fi novels.
