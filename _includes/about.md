My main interest is software engineering. I have been programming from a young age, with most of my work being with web development, predominantly with the PHP framework, [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). My interest in system software has developed over the past few years, building various projects with languages best suited to their use cases (including Python, Java and [Go](https://golang.org/)).

I also hold a casual interest in infosec. I love listening to talks, keeping up to date with recent events, and improving my own cybersecurity skills. I have also participated in bug bounties (including Facebook and eBay's) and CTFs.
    
A few of my specific current interests and projects:

- Learning to build for scale (distributed systems), including taking a deep dive into architecture (Cassandra, Docker and so many other things!)
- [Insurtech](https://artificial.io/products) working at Artificial Labs to digitise a traditionally paper-based industry
- Finding ways to improve traditionally insecure DVRs by building [my own software replacement](https://github.com/kz/swanntools)

I also quite regularly attend hackathons, so you may see me around at them. Outside of computing, I play [fives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWNamssrZAY) (squash, but with your hands!) and enjoy reading sci-fi novels.
